# [DEPRECATED] article-cpp20-coroutines

*The code in this repository was written against experimental and buggy initial support of coroutines and, due to this, contains latent bugs and should not be used. [A more up-to-date coroutines article](https://medium.com/@simontoth/daily-bit-e-of-c-coroutines-step-by-step-e726b976d239) that, however, doesn't go into the gritty details.*

Repository with examples for the C++20 Coroutines video and article.
